# PalindroneCheckerApp


 Flow of project - 

1. Program starts.

2. JVM invokes the main() method.

3. Application name is displayed.

4. Application version is displayed.

5. Program continues to next use case or exits.

Objective 

The objective of the PalindromeChecker App is to design and implement a console-based Java application that validates whether a given string is a palindrome under different conditions, while strengthening core programming fundamentals and data structure concepts.

Key Concepts used in UC1:

Class – Acts as a container for the Palindrome Checker application logic.

Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature
public static void main(String[] args).

Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an object.

Console Output – System.out.println() is used to display messages on the console.

Application Flow Control – Defines the startup behavior before palindrome processing begins.
